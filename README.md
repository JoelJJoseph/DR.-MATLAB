## Inspiration
"A correct diagnosis is three-fourths the remedy." - Mahatma Gandhi
When cells proliferate out of control, cancer develops. According to global statistics, breast cancer (BC) is one of the most frequent malignancies among women globally, accounting for the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths, making it a major public health issue in today's society. Another type of cancer is a brain tumor. And we are in the midst of COVID-19, when people are unable to access hospitals due to overcrowding, not to mention the dread of contracting the sickness.
## Work Plan

## What it does

✅Dr.Matlab Predicts the type of cancer and suggests treatment options. It serves as a one-stop solution for women to find their results without having to wait in long lines, and it also highlights the impacted areas utilizing algorithms such as ADF (Adaptive median filter), Gmm segmentation, and classification.

✅Dr.Matlab uses image segmentation to extend its capabilities to brain tumors.
There are two features to this.
Detect the tumor as well as encircle it.

Both these application contains a user friendly Gui for the users.

## How we built it
✅For the breast cancer detection 
we used Neural Networks and trained them using algorithm such as Adaptive Median filter and then moving towards GMM segmentation and then Intensity& GLCM features extraction and lastly the PNN classifier with shows 3 results such as Benign, Malignant and Normal.

✅For the Brain tumor Detection we used Digital Image processing detection.
It helps to detect the area and encircle the area for better clarity.

## Challenges we ran into
✅We tried our best to train the model, it was tough to gain the highest accuracy.
✅We had to install MATLAB which was around 8.49gb and had to collaborate with the team members. 
✅Time was always a factor.
✅Creating a GUI for both the application


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
✅We created a Gui for the application
✅The implementation of the entire project helped us realize the importance of collaboration and the dynamics of working in a team In every Hackathon, proper time management plays a crucial role that can become a determining factor for the overall progress; we understood the instrumentality of following the code of conduct and treating fellow developers with respect while learning and improving through their feedback.
## What we learned
We learned about matlab and how it works 

## What's next for Dr. MatLab
We want to improve our model accuracy and achieve the best result we can. Maybe we will work with other diseases and make it an online diagnosis for multiple diseases.
